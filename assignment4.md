# Election Contributions

## By: Petruce Jean-Charles

I found that D.C. residents highly favored Elizabeth Warren over Bernie Sanders through political contributions in the 2020 election.

To add onto this story, I would look at the D.C. contributions for both candidates than compare them to how many contributors from D.C. are active in the 2020 election campaigns. I also would interview some of the companies or individuals who donated to Warren to see how they feel about the close numbers of donations between sanders and Warren. This story would likely take two to three days to report.

When searching for a story, I did the following:

  1. Searched the FEC website for donations in the 2020 election cycle from D.C. residents
  
  2. Filtered only contributions for Elizabeth Warren and exported a CSV file of the results
  
  3. Repeated the same process with Bernie Sander's presidential campaign contributions
  
  4. For both CSVs I: 
  
  - took a sum of the contribution amount
  
  - subtracted the sums and came up with a percentage that showed Warren's higher donation numbers

Nut graf: Climbing the polls, neck and neck, Elizabeth Warren gains hundreds more contributors and racks in more campaign donations in D.C. 

Who has a chance at a successful campaign run? For now the answer still stands a question.
