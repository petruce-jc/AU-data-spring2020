# Cleaning School Dataset

## By: Petruce Jean-Charles
Filled in blank spots under enrollment
Fixed the names of schools and blank spots under school preferences
Filled in blank spots of school assigned

The dataset showed NYC parents reporting their kidsâ€™ scores on the gifted and talented exam. 

I made multiple changes, including:

  1. Change One: Separating the date from the time
  
  2. Change Two: Put n/a in blank spots under district, fixed the numbers of the districts to be consistent and under the OLSAT verbal score fixed the fraction scores and put n/a in the blank ones.
  
  3. Change Three: Filled in blank spots under enrollment, fixed the names of schools and blank spots under school preferences and filled in blank spots of school assigned.
