# Grocery Gap Dataset

## By: Petruce Jean-Charles

According to the USDA, 39.4 million Americans still live in communities that far away from grocery stores that supply healthier food options. Most of these Americans live in low-income neighborhoods requiring transportation to these stores. I want to use data to show the inconsistencies of healthier foods in these areas, as well as the struggles when traveling to these stores.

Here are the features I'll be collecting, and an explanation of why:

1.The states with the most populated cities.

2.Well-known or populated cities in these states.

3.The common grocery store chains available in these cities.

4.The forms of transportation people often use in these cities.

5.The monthly cost of transportation, assuming that a person would go food shopping each month.

I will collect the data by recording a few states with the most populated or well-known cities. I will then use Google to see what food chains are in each city, common transportation methods, and the cost of a monthly pass.

| State | City      | Store         | Transportation | Cost Average |
|-------|-----------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| NY    | Bronx     | Stop & Shop   | Subway         | $116.50      |
| CA    | Clearlake | Safeway       | Bus            | $100.00      |
| OH    | Cleveland | Marc's Stores | Bus            | $62.00       |
| CO    | Alamosa   | Safeway       | Bus            | $114.00      |
| FL    | De Soto   | Winn-Dixie    | Bus            | $145.00      |
