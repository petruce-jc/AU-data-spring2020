Mapping out healthy food in low-income areas

By: Petruce Jean-Charles

The U.S. Census Bureau recorded in 2010 that the median household income declined, while the poverty rate increased. The average household income decreased by 2.3% at $46, 445, but recent findings have found that some low-income neighborhoods are as low as $15,000. 

American University student journalists found that many low-income neighborhoods lack healthy grocery stores and set out to discover the reasoning behind limited options, where these grocery stores were located and how far families had to travel to gain access to healthier foods.

Introduction to food deserts:

According to the United States Department of Agriculture, food deserts bring concerns of food insecurity, unhealthy diets and transportation issues. 

Alana Rhone, agricultural economist for the USDA, has spent time researching food access across the country and said, “both urban and rural low-income neighborhoods still have a difficulty of obtaining healthy food.”

Food deserts are geographic areas where residents have little to no access to affordable, healthy food options such as fruits and vegetables. Residents are often restricted from getting access to grocery stores because they are outside of neighborhood limits, which is inconvenient for many. 

Many urban areas have access to transportation, but residents struggle due to far distances and the costs the distances create. The department found that 2.3 million people in low-income neighborhoods live more than one mile away from a supermarket and do not own a car. 

Another issue is that healthy grocery stores are driven out of these neighborhoods because of economics, crime and other factors that are generally seen in low-income neighborhoods. 

Low-income neighborhoods demographically house people of color, and in these areas grocery stores are limited and if they are available have a smaller selection of healthy foods. Wealthier and more affluent areas have three times as many supermarkets as low-income neighborhoods because stores see value in the demographic. 

Unfortunately businesses leave low-income neighborhoods with the assumption that residents can’t afford the food they are selling, which drops their profits. Corner stores profit off of low-income neighborhoods, selling large quantities of cheap meat, dairy and processed foods that cost less to make.

Lack of affordable food creates an inability for families to get healthy food and research shows that transportation is a weighing factor.

Mapping out the grocery stores:

Student Journalists Petruce Jean-Charles and Cara Hackett spent weeks researching and discovering inconsistencies within 25 urban and 25 rural low-income neighborhoods. An analysis was performed to identify the amount of time it took for a person in a low-income neighborhood to get to a grocery, with hopes to further show the need for better assistance in food deserts.

Preliminary research showed that low-income families had to travel to get to the nearest healthy food store, creating concerns of monthly transportation costs and distance. 

About 45 percent of low-income people live within 0.5 miles from the nearest store in comparison to 37 percent of moderate to high-income people. Prior research further showed that the median distance for urban low-income residents was 0.62 miles from the nearest food store, however, families without cars were a mile or more away.

Jean-Charles investigated the following 25 urban neighborhoods, Mott Haven, N.Y.; Chinatown, Calif.; Roxbury, Mass.; Dayton-; Park, N.J.; :, D.C.; Overtown, Fla.; Armour Square, Ill.; South Park, Wash.; Fairhill, Pa.; Ventura Village, Minn.; Oldtown-Chinatown, Ore.; West Baltimore, Md.; Mechanicsville, Ga.; Bram’s Addition, Wis.; Capitol Hill, Colo.; Fountain Park, Mo.; Montopolis, Texas; Kinsmith, Ohio; Viavant-Venetian Isles, La.; Westover Hills, N.C.; Spartan Village, Va.; Downtown, Neb.; Caldwell, Idaho; Alta Monte, N.M. and Forest Park, Mich.

Each neighborhood had the lowest income average and highest crime rate in each state. Research showed that crime was a concerning factor in food deserts due to the increase in food insecurity. Food insecurity is the lack of available financial resources, which affects the access of nutritious and sustainable foods. 

Grocery stores do not understand the domino-effects their absence has on low-income areas and because of that other stores are deterred from opening locations.

More data was then collected by finding a common healthy food store chain, Whole Foods. There are over 480 Whole Food stores, yet many choose not to settle in low-income areas. Jean-Charles then confirmed that all 25 neighborhoods were near or towns away from Whole Foods. 

Jean-Charles then used Google Maps to track the different transportation methods to the store, the amount of time for travel in minutes and the miles between each point. 

Each neighborhood was tracked by the state, neighborhood, region, day of week, time of day and transportation times. 

Research findings show a disheartening reality:

Research showed that the average American goes to a grocery store on weekends between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. 

Public transportation is accessible in urban low-income neighborhoods but due to the distance and the time it takes to travel, the commute can be long. The average transportation method is a bus or a bus-to-train transfer, but it is not cheap. 

Between all 25 low-income neighborhoods the average monthly bus cost is $78. The price can buy a bag of Jasmine rice, two pound of meat, vegetables, potatoes and any other important food for sustainability at a grocery store.

Google map tracking showed that bus-to-train transfers were common for east coast neighborhoods, with bus times ranging from 22 to 1 hour and 35 minutes, with an average of 47 minutes. 

The midwest neighborhoods had shorter bus times averaging out at 37 minutes with the highest time being 1 and 20 minute. Peak traffic times were also considered and were not implemented in the research, which means that weekend transportation times are slower and delayed. 

West coast neighborhoods had an average bus time of 51 minutes, with the highest time being 2 hours and 56 minutes. Further research showed that transportation in the west coast is limited and troublesome for low-income neighborhoods due to the fact that other affluent towns nearby drive. 

Research also emphasized how far a nearby Whole Foods was when tracking distance by walking. Most low-income residents don’t drive or have cars to save money on gas, high maintenance hosts or they live in a city where public transportation is highly promoted, yet not always convenient.

When tracking the walking distances, the average walk time was over an hour. But corner stores mark almost every corner in an urban low-income area. For example, additional mapping in Mott Haven shows there are over 16 convenient stores within a 0.5 or more radius. 

More time, more progress:

If there were more time to do research, Jean-Charles would have reached out to residents who have actual questions and concerns about accessible grocery stores. 

To help overcome the limited access, some state and local groups have introduced programs that provide financial assistance and incentives to bring and build stores for higher access to healthy food.

“Even though the number of healthy grocery stores in low-income neighborhoods may not be where we want it to be, the total number of grocery stores have increased over the years,” Rhone said. “It’s just a matter of bringing them closer to those who need it.”
