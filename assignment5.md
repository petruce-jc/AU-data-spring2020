# Story Pitch

By: Petruce Jean-Charles

I plan to analyze the amount of time it takes for a person in a low-income neighborhood to get to a grocery store. What I want to find is who is affected by the distance, how far the grocery store is and what common transportation methods are taken? I have also decided to partner with another classmate and we have decided to divide this project based on urban and rural areas. She is interested in focusing on 25 rural areas and I am interested in 25 urban areas. I'm also interested to see if there is a certain demographic or trend of the people in these areas.

To accomplish this, I will use data that shows areas around the U.S. that are low-income or low access, as well as Google Maps to collect my own samples of the distances. I will also use data from the USDA Altas, a map that color codes low income and low access neighborhoods throughout the country.

I plan to vizualize the distance of rides to stores. I could also visualize with color the number of grocery stores near the areas I choose.

This is timely because food deserts are everwhere, limiting the amount of affordable and nutritious food obtainable in comparison to healthier grocery chains. Food deserts and lack of nutritious food can contribute to other issues as well.

For sources, my partner and I plan to talk to Agricultural Economist Alana Rhone, whose research focuses on food access in the U.S. Through her I also plan to get other contacts that may work alongside her or have other information. I also plan to contact some of the board members at the Food Trust, a nonprofit that works to provide access to affordable and healthy foods.
