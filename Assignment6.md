# Interviewing a dataset

By: Petruce Jean-Charles

I decided to look at thefts in Ward 1 over the past week. Since last week there has been 21 reported incidents of theft.

A few questions I have are:

1. Are the areas in highly populated parts of the districts in Ward 1?

2. What are the trends seen of thiefs by the victims?

3. What have police done to lessen the amount of thefts in Districts 3 and 4?

When cleaning the data:

- I filled in blank area with N/A under end date

- Used the coordinates to see what specific towns were being targeted

- Separated offense key blocks from BID blocks (property and theft/others)

- Made sure that the block numbers were consistent, (1300-1339 block u street was once 300 and 339)

- Capitalized the ANC district letters

While doing research from the dataset, I found that many of the thefts were in Columbia Heights in areas surrounding 14th ST NW, which is a shopping center hub.

Headline: One week later, three weeks worth of stolen goods.

In the past week, 21 thefts took place in Ward 1. However, thefts went down by 20 due to extra police officers placed in high populated areas. Police officers have been seen on bicycles, walking, cars and scooters scaring away potential thefts, but 21 is still three weeks worth of thefts.
