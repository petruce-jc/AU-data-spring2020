# Story Ideas

## By: Petruce Jean-Charles

1.I am interested in working on a story about the correlation between low-income neighborhoods and grocery store accesibility. Specifically on transportation and how far  grocery stores are in low-income neighborhoods in big cities across the country. I would compare each area and record how far the places are, how long it takes and what types of transportation sources people use to show the inconsistencies in food sources in these areas. I also am interested in finding out how much money is spent on getting to these stores pre-shopping. 

I am interested in questioning whether grocery prices are higher in low-income neighborhoods? The sales of corner stores? How residents are being affected by the prices of food?

Critique: [The Grocery Gap] (http://thefoodtrust.org/test/administrative/hffi-impacts/the-grocery-gap). 

Clarity and accuracy: The clarity was a four because I was easily able to identify that there is a grocery gap in low-income areas that are predominately African-American and Latino residents. I was also able to navigate the data due to the different subsections in and near the article with links to each case study. One thing I would recommend would be to add an actual link to the USDA, which I would use later on. Aside from that I would give the navigation a 3.

I believe that the data is accurate due to the various examples of studies and the addition of the USDA at the beginning of the article, which gave me the ability to research on my own. The researcher also summarized the whole agenda by titling it the grocery gap which gives the reader a hint as to what the article is about.

Quality: The quality of the article was a four because it explained the groups of people that are being affected by this gap, the areas in this gap and history pertaining to the issue. I think they could approve by possibly adding personal experience of people in these neighborhoods, or conducting a survey that can be used as a graphic.

Type and color: In the article the title was the same color as the website and the information about where some of the data was taken was bolded, but other than that the article was basic. What drew me to the article was the graphic and from the graphic I was interested in reading more. Color could have been more incorporated in the article, so I would give it a 2.

Creativity: The piece was creative because of the layout of the research and I would give it a 3.

2.The second idea is about the affectiveness of healthy eating through farmers markets in low-income neighborhoods. I am interested in researching how accessible farmers markets are in relation to grocery stores. I am aware in D.C. there are programs for healthier foods, but I want to know how many people in these neighborhoods are taking advantage of this resource.

How helpful are farmers markets for healthier eating in low-income neighborhoods? Is there data showing who goes to these markets based on gender and race?

Critique: [New Report] (https://www.pps.org/article/new-report-on-farmers-markets-low-income-communities).

Clarity and accuracy: The clarity of this article was a 3 because it did break down the different points it wanted to project, however, if there were more graphics the article would have been clearer. The central insight is that there is research examining the accessibility of farmers market in low-income areas. 

I also wasn't sure that there was data in the first place, but realized I had to click a link to download the full pdf version. I would give the article a 2 because I would have liked to see graphics embed in the article. An improvement would be to embed some information from the pdf, or create a chart. In terms of accuracy, if I didn't look at the pdf I would think the data was based on opinion but because they referenced it I was able to fact-check it myself. 

Quality: I think the article did well in breaking down the different reasons that affect whether people go to farmers markets. For example, mentioning outreach efforts was something I didn't think was considered when going to a farmers market. But the article could improve with a map of these areas that point where farmers markets are in comparison to these neighborhoods.

Type and color: I would give the color a 1 because there wasn't any distinction in the information that would attract me to read more, but because of the title mentioning new data I was drawn to read on. 

Creativity: The article didn't really have a creative element aside from photos so I would give this section a 1. But because of my research topic I thought it was important to read the information.
